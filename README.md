# Polynomial-Calculator
Polynomial Calculator build with Java
Data Structures Course

## Description:##
This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in data structures problem-solving by
creating a practical tool for manipulating polynomials, The project involves creating a Polynomial
Calculator based on the LinkedList data structure.
Users will be able to input polynomials and perform operations on them, including addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation.
The LinkedList data structure will be used to efficiently store and manipulate polynomial terms.
Each term, consisting of a coefficient and an exponent, will be stored as a node in the LinkedList.
In this way, polynomials of different degrees can be resized and manipulated easily.
It will handle common errors like division by zero or invalid input by providing a user-friendly
interface for inputting polynomial equations, simplifying expressions, and performing arithmetic
operations.
